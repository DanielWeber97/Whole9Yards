# Whole9Yards
About:
Whole9Yards is a comprehensive lawn service employee app. It uses Firebase to seamlessly store data about all your clients on any employees'
Android device. In its current state, it provides easy access to the entire client database, which includes their names,
phone numbers, and addresses. Currently working on the rest of the features to create Google calender integration, geofencing to 
start a timer to see how long each job takes, and send a confirmation when the employee leaves.
